# `@codnx/mlxd`

**MLXD (Machine Learning eXperiment Deployment)** is a CI/CD testing tool for machine learning workflows. This CLI simplifies testing, configuration, and encryption of ML model performance metrics in a secure and standalone manner.

---

## **Features**

- **Run ML Tests**: Evaluate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall for ML models.
- **Fully Configurable**: Easily define model paths, datasets, and test criteria using a `config.yaml` file.

---

## **Quick Start**

### **1. Installation**

Install the CLI globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @codnx/mlxd
```

---

### **2. Initialize Configuration**

Run the following command to create a `config.yaml` file in the current directory:

```bash
mlxd init
```

---

### **3. Configure `config.yaml`**

Edit the generated `config.yaml` file to specify your model and dataset paths, along with the test criteria. Example:

```yaml
dataPath: "./data/dataset.csv"
tests:
  - name: "Accuracy Test"
    type: "metric_threshold"
    metric: "accuracy"
    threshold: 0.9
```

---

### **4. Run Tests**

Run the tests defined in the configuration file:

```bash
mlxd run
```

Results will be displayed in the console.

---

## **Commands**

### **Initialization**

- **`mlxd init`**:  
  Creates a `config.yaml` template in the current directory.

### **Run Tests**

- **`mlxd run`**:  
  Executes the tests defined in `config.yaml`.

### **Version**

- **`mlxd --version` or `mlxd -v`**:  
  Displays the current version of the CLI.

### **Uninstall**

- **`mlxd uninstall`**:  
  Removes the CLI from your system.

---

## **Example Workflow**

1. **Install the CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @codnx/mlxd
   ```

2. **Create a Configuration File**:

   ```bash
   mlxd init
   ```

3. **Edit `config.yaml`**:

   ```yaml
   dataPath: "./data/dataset.csv"
   tests:
     - name: "Accuracy Test"
       type: "metric_threshold"
       metric: "accuracy"
       threshold: 0.9
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:

   ```bash
   mlxd run
   ```

5. **Uninstall the CLI**:

   ```bash
   mlxd uninstall
   ```

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

- **No `config.yaml` found**:  
  Ensure you run `mlxd init` to generate the configuration file.

- **Model or dataset file not found**:  
  Verify that the paths in `config.yaml` (`modelPath` and `dataPath`) point to valid files.

---

### **Check CLI Version**

Confirm the installed version using:

```bash
mlxd --version
```
